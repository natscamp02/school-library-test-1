# Stony Hill Primary School - Library

The Stony Hill Primary School has embarked on a project to modernize their school library. You are given the task to create a solution that will:

-   Allow students to go online and search for different categories of books and make a request to borrow a book. This request will then be approved by a Librarian once the book is available and the student does not have more than 2 books outstanding.

-   The student will then be able to borrow the selected book and the librarian will record the loan in the system.

-   The Librarian should give the student 2 weeks to return the book (This can be automatically calculated based on the borrowed date)

-   Books that are overdue should be displayed in red

-   The system should have proper login management to ensure that students or unauthorized persons do not have access to Library information
